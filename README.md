# CrohnsModeling

**CrohnsModeling** is a computational modeling project focused on simulating chronic intestinal inflammation dynamics observed in Crohn’s disease using mechanistic mathematics, stochastic processes, and numerical simulation. The goal is to build a modular, research-grade framework that captures flare–remission cycles, spatial inflammation propagation, and (optionally) inflammation-linked tumor initiation.

## 🔬 Project Overview

Crohn’s disease involves complex interactions between immune activity, epithelial damage, microbial stimuli, and tissue repair. This project implements simplified but biologically informed computational models to study:

- Spatial inflammation propagation (reaction–diffusion PDEs)  
- Stochastic flare events and immune activation  
- Tissue recovery dynamics  
- Long-horizon system behavior under varied parameter regimes  
- Optional: inflammation-driven tumor initiation as a coupled model  

This repository is intended as a **scientific sandbox** for exploring how chronic inflammation evolves over time using mathematical and numerical tools.
